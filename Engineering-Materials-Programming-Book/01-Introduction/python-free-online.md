## Python Free Online

You may not be able to install the Anaconda distribution of Python. A couple reasons you might not be able to install Anaconda are:

 * You are using a school or work computer that you can't install programs.
 * You are using a chromebook or tablet and Anaconda can't be installed on it
 * Your Anaconda installation failed and you can't figure out why

If you can't install Anaconda, you can still use Python for free with a couple different online resources. These options include:

 * **Google CoLab**
 * **Azure Notebooks** (from Microsoft)
 * **Datalore** (from JetBrains)

All of these options require a username and password for the particular service and all three are free.

### Google CoLab

If you have access to the Google suite of online tools such as gmail, Google Calendar and Google Drive, Google CoLab is a good free Python option. 

When you write Python code in Google CoLab, your code is saved in your Google Drive.

You can access Google CoLab using the web address below:

 > [https://colab.google.com](https://colab.google.com)

This will create a new notebook for you to code in. 

### Azure Notebooks

If you use the Microsoft suite of tools such as Outlook, and OneDrive, Azure Notebooks is a place you can write and run Python code. 

Join Azure Notebooks using the link below:

 > [https://notebooks.azure.com/](https://notebooks.azure.com/)

To use Azure Notebooks, you'll need a Microsoft account username and password.

### Datalore

Datalore was created by Jet Brains, the company that makes PyCharm. PyCharm is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Python. 

You can create a Datalore account using the URL below:

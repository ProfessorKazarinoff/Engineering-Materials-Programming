Engineering Materials Programming Book
============================

This is a small collection of resources for using computer programming in a college Introduction to Materials Science and Engineering course. This type of course is often part of the second year of a Mechancial Engineering college degree.

Each chapter corresponds to one of the general topics covered in the course. Within each chapter are example problems in materials science and solutions to those problems using compter programming.

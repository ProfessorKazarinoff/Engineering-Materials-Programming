# Mechanical Properties

The examples in this chapter revolve around the mechanical properties of materials. These properties include:

 * tensile strength
 * yield strength
 * elastic modulus
 * ductility
 * toughness
 * hardness

Building stres-strain curves using data from a mechanical test frame will be a major part of examples in this chapter.

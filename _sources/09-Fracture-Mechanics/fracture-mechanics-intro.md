# Fracture Mechanics

Fracture mechanics is the study of how materials fail under load. Besides stresses that exceed a material's tensile strength, materials can fail in a variety of ways. These failure methods include crack propigation, fatigue, and creep.

This chapter contains examples of fracture mechanics problems solved with programming.

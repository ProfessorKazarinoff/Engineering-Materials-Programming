# Introduction

This first Introduction chapter contains sections on the Python programming language and how to install it on your computer. I recommend the [Anaconda](https://https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution of Python, instead of installing Python from Python.org

There is also a section on how open a Jupyter notebook.

If you are using a Chromebook, iPad or Tablet, there are ways to run Python online. See the section on how to use Python for free online.

The last section in this chapter is on unit conversions and using a Python package called pint.
